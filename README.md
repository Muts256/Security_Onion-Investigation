- <b> Digital Forensics </b>
  - [Security Onion Investigation](https://github.com/Muts256/Security_Onion-Investigation)

The investigation using Security Onion provides a comprehensive analysis of the network traffic captured in a pcap file. The integrated tools enable security teams to identify anomalies and correlate events, ultimately confirming the presence of suspicious behaviour that may indicate an incident.

Objective:
  - To enhance practical skills using a SIEM.
  - Installation and configuration of Security Onion.
  - Search for anomalies/unusual behaviour.
  - Importing a pcap into Security Onion.
  - Use OSINT tools, e.g., Virus Total, AbuseIPDB, to gather more details about the anomalies and artifacts collected.
  - Using Gary Kessler's Magic number to identify discrepancies in file extensions.
  - Document the findings. See PDF above.

Lessons Learned:
  - Using Gary Kessler's Magic number to identify discrepancies in file extensions
  - Using OSINT tools such as Virustotal. 
  - Searching for anomalies
  - Importing a pcap into Security Onion
